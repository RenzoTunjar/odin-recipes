First assignment/project with The Odin Project. Learned/learning how to write in html & css, and combining them to make a website come life. 

Creating directories and files, and creating a website slowly but surely. So often I would commit and save my code so I can track my previous steps if there has been any mistakes or if things just end up not working. 

There are many ways to write successful code and everyone has their own way of doing it but I would like to practice more so it can be easy to read to the reader.
